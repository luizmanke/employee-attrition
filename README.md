# Employee Attrition

Employee attrition refers to the loss of employees through a natural process, such as retirement, resignation, elimination of a position, personal health, or other similar reasons. It causes redution in size and/or strengths of workforce and can increase the workload for the remaining employees. Not only that, hiring new people can be financial and time consuming for a company, since it has to spend time in a good onboarding, trainings and development.

For those reasons, the goal of this project is to understand the main causes and think of solutions to avoid employees attrition.
